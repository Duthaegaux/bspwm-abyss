# bspwm_dotfiles
 Customized for my neeeds bspwm.


As the base I used bspwm_nord from prolinux410 (https://gitlab.com/prolinux410/owl_dots/-/tree/main/bspwm/bspwm_nord). Thx a lot!

I changed it to use on my laptop (HP EliteBook 840 G3) with 1366x768 resolution.

As for me, I edited Information panel:
- Added battery indicator, changed pulseaudio module and swap places icon a little bit
- Changed text color for all indicators to white
- Added some hotkeys such as super+shift+s for flameshot screenshot (like in windows lol)
- Deleted powermenu button, use super+ctrl+p to shutdown and super+ctrl+r to reboot

Hope you enjoy this custom, bye ;D
